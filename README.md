# NYC_AirBnB (Power BI)

This Power BI dashboard is part of a two-part analysis of the NYC Airbnb Open Data 2019 dataset. It complements the SQL-based exploration of the same dataset, showcasing my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using both SQL and Power BI.

## üìä Project Summary

The goal of this project is to visualize patterns in Airbnb listings across New York City‚Äîspecifically focusing on pricing, availability, neighborhood trends, and host behavior. The dashboard provides an interactive and insightful overview that would be useful for travelers, hosts, or Airbnb itself.

## üìÅ Dataset

- Source: [Inside Airbnb ‚Äì NYC 2019](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
- Shape: 49,000+ listings with features such as room type, price, number of reviews, location, host details

## üìÑ Report Structure

### 1. **Accommodation Overview**
- Distribution of listings by neighborhood and room type
- Key performance indicators: total daily revenue, median/mean/mode prices
- Custom DAX measures to reflect filtered pricing data

### 2. **Pricing & Host Analysis**
- Average price by neighborhood group
- Hosts with the most listings
- Price vs. number of reviews (scatterplot)
- Map visualization of listing density across NYC

## üîç Key Insights

- **Manhattan and Brooklyn** account for the vast majority of listings.
- **Entire homes/apartments** are the most common accommodation type (~52%).
- **Daily revenue nears $1 billion**, highlighting the economic impact of short-term rentals.
- **Mode price is $100**, but the average is higher‚Äîindicating the presence of high-priced outliers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

- Power BI Desktop  
- Data Modeling & Relationships  
- DAX Measures (e.g., dynamic average price calculations)  
- Visualizations: bar, pie, map, scatterplot, KPI cards
